__Data visualization__ is the discipline of trying to understand data by placing it in a visual context so that patterns, trends and correlations that might not otherwise be detected can be exposed.

Python offers multiple great graphing libraries that come packed with lots of different features.

__popular plotting libraries:__

- __Matplotlib:__ low level, provides lots of freedom
- __Pandas Visualization:__ easy to use interface, built on Matplotlib
- __Seaborn:__ high-level interface, great default styles
- __ggplot:__ based on Râ€™s ggplot2, uses Grammar of Graphics
- __Plotly:__ can create interactive plots
